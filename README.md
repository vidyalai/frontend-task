1. Draw curves
2. Erase drawn lines

Whiteboard UI - [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/b32qPPweMJPTZ29711DNtW/Frontend-Task?node-id=0%3A1) . Create an account in Figma to view the design and download assets. The app you make should **follow the design as closely as possible**.

A basic whiteboard with drawing features has already been made for you, and you can use it as a starting point. To run it:

1. Clone(do not fork) this repository to your system
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start`
4. Access the app from http://localhost:3000. Click and drag your mouse to draw.

To complete the task, you can build on top of this repo, or you can start from scratch.

Extra Credit:
1. Add multiple pages to the whiteboard
2. Make it collaborative (Like Google Jamboard, using firebase or custom server side code)
3. Add more tools (Pan, Shapes, Highlighter etc.)

Once you complete the task, submit your work by [**filling this form with a link to your repository**](https://forms.gle/d7gBSwfFf6FjQdeZA).
